        <h2>The <strong>book</strong> in a nutshell</h2>
        <p>
          The success of a small group is often judged by their outcomes, such as the numbers of members attending regularly, their spiritual practices around
          worship and prayer, their ability to care for each other, and their capacity to reach out to their community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little attention has been given to the power of conversation that happens within their meetings. This book is a personal testimony of how a
          straight-forward five-stage coaching framework, supported by seven principles and examples of great questions, can lead to your small group members
          thriving out of their godly identity and moving towards their ultimate calling of God in their lives.

        <h2>What is a Powerful Conversation?</h2>
        <p>
          A powerful conversation is an intentional conversation which supports a group of people to work through their thinking/challenges, using a series of
          coaching type questions, while collectively listening to the Holy Spirit and praying together.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>What are the stages & principles of a Powerful Conversation?</h2>
        <p>
          The stages of the framework are rooted in ideas of critical thinking and enquiry-based learning and can be used to support your group to delve deeper
          into a conversation relating to the bible, a sermon, a video, and a book etc. Its 5 stages, check-in, share, explore, consider and check-out, will
          guide and transform your group members’ discussion. Combined with its 7 underpinning principles, it will help your group members to go deeper with
          their faith and thrive out of their godly identity.

            "Leading powerful conversations is a working resource, easy to pick up and read, that catches the important principles in facilitating a small
            group. Steve clearly and simply explains practical steps that can help all small group leaders whether they are an old hand in group leadership or
            anyone facing it fresh. Many may know some of these basic steps but not have put them together in the way Steve has managed. I recommend church
            leaders getting hold of this and giving it to the small group leaders in their churches."

            "Leading Powerful Conversations not only removes the overwhelm as a Small Group leader in planning for a session but, most importantly, it
            facilitates transformation of oneself and group members at a personal level. Internalising the five steps in weekly discussion and conversation not
            only positively changes the Small Group conversation dynamic but leaves an imprint on individuals, carrying coaching distinctives into workplaces,
            society, and churches as a result."

            "As I was looking through this book, two words jumped out at me. Those words were 'Spiritual Hospitality'. Having been described as a hospitable
            person, I began to wonder how those words could be applied to my small group leadership role. If, like me, you are eager to learn more about this, I
            commend you to study this book so that we can become more fully engaged with our small groups, especially within the remit of spiritual hospitality.
            Thank you for pulling this resource together, not only to further equip us as small group leaders but also to ensure that all members of the small
            group flourish as they grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ."
