        <h2>The <strong>book</strong> in a nutshell</h2>
        <p>
          The success of a small group is often judged by their outcomes, such as the numbers of members attending regularly, their spiritual practices around
          worship and prayer, their ability to care for each other, and their capacity to reach out to their community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little attention has been given to the power of conversation that happens within their meetings. This book is a personal testimony of how a
          straight-forward five-stage coaching framework, supported by seven principles and examples of great questions, can lead to your small group members
          thriving out of their godly identity and moving towards their ultimate calling of God in their lives.

          coaching type questions, while collectively listening to the Holy Spirit and praying together.
        </p>

          The stages of the framework are rooted in ideas of critical thinking and enquiry-based learning and can be used to support your group to delve deeper
          into a conversation relating to the bible, a sermon, a video, and a book etc. Its 5 stages, check-in, share, explore, consider and check-out, will
          guide and transform your group members’ discussion. Combined with its 7 underpinning principles, it will help your group members to go deeper with
